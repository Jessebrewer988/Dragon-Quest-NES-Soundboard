# Dragon Quest(NES) Soundboard
A vanilla JavaScript soundboard featuring sounds from the first Dragon Quest(NES).

## Motivation

To test out some key events with transitions. Also, I love Dragon Quest!

## Technology

The logic is written entirely in JavaScript with minor ES6 syntax. 

## Sounds

The sounds are straight from the game! Audio and visual elements belong to Square-Enix.
